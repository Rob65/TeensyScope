# TeensyScope
Teensy 4 oscilloscope / XY Display

This is supposed to become an enhanced, stand alone, version of TeensyLogger, originally created
by Bernd Ulmann (https://github.com/anabrid/TeensyLogger).
The idea behind the project is to create an affordable display for The Analog Thing
(see https://the-analog-thing.org/)

## Proof of concept

The current status is that there is a proof of concept consisting of a 3.5" 480x320 TFT module connected to a Teensy 4.1. It *should be* possible to connect this almost directly to THAT (some buffering/ESD protecting must be added)
